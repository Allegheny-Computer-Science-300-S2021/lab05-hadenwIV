#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

The software that I used to conduct my analysis  was the Freiburg RNA Tools that can be found on http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/Teaching/index.jsp?toolName=Needleman-Wunsch. The reason why I used this tool for my analysis is that I was able to  input the long genetic sequences and  quickly find  the results for the data

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 The two sequences for s1.fasta and s2.fasta are very similar genetic sequences.


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 I would say that the two sequences are extremly related to each other because of the high score of 29 in the Needleman Wunsch algorithm.


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?


For this claim  the genetic sequences are similar comes from the score of 29 that was obtained at the end of a comparisons so this  tells me  that there's no random chances of being related and that they have a lot of genetic overlapping .


#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

There is a very high degree of similarity between all of the sequences but with some more than others. Specifically the sequences that were most closely related was sequence "b" Influenza_A_China (human) and sequence "c" Influenza_avian Hong_Kong2007. 


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?


I believe that there is a little  concern for the H5N1 viruses could develop the capacity of human to human transmission. I base this concern from the similarity of the human isolate sequence that was found in China and the Influenza virus that was found in Hong Kong. While only being 3 % different there is still enough siiliarties betwen te two to keep an eye out for the viruses .

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?


2005 & 2006

Length: 1776
Similarity:  1690/1776 (95.2%)
Gaps:          45/1776 ( 2.5%)
Score: 9435.0
2006 & 2007

Length: 1776
Similarity:  1731/1776 (97.5%)
Gaps:          25/1776 ( 1.4%)
Score: 9703.0
2005 & 2007

Length: 1751
Similarity:  1681/1751 (96.0%)
Gaps:          20/1751 ( 1.1%)
Score: 9379.
